                <p>Bhagat Singh <b>(28 September 1907-23 March 1931)</b> was an Indian socialist revolutionary. He is
                    considered to be one of the most influential revolutionaries of the Indian Independence Movement.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Bhagat Singh was born to Vidyavati Kaur and Sardar Kishan Singh, in a Sikh Jat family on 28
                    September 1907
                    at Lyallpur in Punjab Province of British India. His family had earlier been involved in
                    revolutionary activities against the British government.

                    His uncle, Swaran Singh, had participated in the freedom struggle against the British. When in 1907,
                    an another uncle of Bhagat, Ajit Singh was arrested and exiled to Rangoon in Burma, Swaran asked the
                    people of Punjab to force the government for his release and due to his efforts Ajit Singh was
                    released from Rangoon Jail in October 1907.

                    After coming back from jail, Ajit Singh decided to start a major revolt against the British. He
                    began agitating the farmers and peasants to start a movement against them. The movement called
                    'Pagdi Sambhal Jatta' was launched in 1908.

                    In 1912, Bhagat joined the District Primary School in Lyallpur and received his elementary education
                    there till class 5th. In 1917, his family shifted to Lahore for his higher education. In Lahore, he
                    was admitted to the Dayanand Anglo-Vedic (D.A.V) School, and he received rest of his elementary
                    education from there. When he was in the 8th standard, the Jallianwala Bagh massacre (13 April 1919)
                    took place. The very next day (on 14 April) he went to the bagh telling at his home that he was
                    going to school. After running about 30 miles from Lahore, Bhagat reached Amritsar. At 2 pm, as
                    Bhagat entered the bagh's compound he saw blood scattered all over the ground. The turbans and torn
                    clothes of panic-stricken people laid lifeless on the ground. The walls of the compound were red
                    with blood. As it was curfew in Punjab those days, the blood hadn't been cleaned. Bhagat had taken a
                    glass bottle with him before leaving from home. He took a handful of blood-stained soil and put it
                    in the bottle. He reached home and put the bottle infront of the Sikh Guru's portrait and prayed to
                    him for peace and solace for the victims of the massacre and he pledged to teach the British a
                    lesson.

                    <h3>Legacy and Memorials:</h3>
                    <p>
                        Bhagat Singh remains a significant figure in Indian iconography to the present day. His
                        memory, however, defies categorisation and presents problems for various groups that might try
                        to appropriate it.Bhagat Singh represents a challenge to almost every tendency in Indian
                        politics. Gandhi-inspired Indian nationalists, Hindu nationalists, Sikh nationalists, the
                        parliamentary Left and the pro-armed struggle Naxalite Left compete with each other to
                        appropriate the legacy of Bhagat Singh, and yet each one of them is faced with a contradiction
                        in making a claim to his legacy.
